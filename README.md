# Bengaluru_house_predictive_analysis
**Introduction**
The goal of this project is to predict house prices in Bengaluru based on various features such as location, size, total square feet, and amenities. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and exporting the trained model for future use.

**Dataset Information**
The dataset contains various features related to house properties in Bengaluru. Key features include:
- Area Type: The type of area (e.g., Super built-up Area, Plot Area).
- Location: The location of the house.
- Size: The size of the house (e.g., 2 BHK, 3 BHK).
- Total Sqft: The total square feet area of the house.
- Bath: The number of bathrooms.
- Price: The price of the house.

**Data Preprocessing**
Data preprocessing steps include:

- Loading Data: Load the dataset and display the first few rows.
- Handling Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features and transform existing ones to improve model performance.
- Encoding Categorical Variables: Use one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
**Model Building**
Steps for building the predictive model:

- Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for the task.
- Training the Model: Train the model using the training data.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model parameters for better performance.

  
**Model Evaluation**
Evaluate the model using various metrics to ensure its performance:

- Accuracy
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
**Exporting the Model**
After training and evaluating the model, export the model and relevant data for future use:

- Export the Model: Save the trained model using pickle.
- Save Location and Column Information: Save information about locations and columns to be used in the prediction application.
